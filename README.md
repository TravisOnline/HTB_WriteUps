# HTB_WriteUps

Write-ups of machine's I've rooted. Unfortunately some of them are active machines which I cannot supply write-ups for. I have a directory for my own reference to reference successful pentesting techniques.

If you're attempting currently active machines, please don't look at it lol. You are just depriving yourself of important learning experiences.
