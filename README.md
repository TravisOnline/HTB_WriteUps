# HTB_WriteUps

Write-ups of machine's I've rooted. Unfortunately some of them are active machines which I cannot supply write-ups for. I have a directory for my own reference to reference successful pentesting techniques. I have many more active machines under my belt than listed here. Foolishly I lost my notes that I kept in sublime, but never bothered to save.

If you're attempting currently active machines, please don't look at it lol. You are just depriving yourself of important learning experiences.
